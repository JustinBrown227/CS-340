# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I use clear documentation and descriptive names to make the code understandable. I implement error handling and unit tests to ensure reliability. Design code to be easily extended or modified to adapt to future needs. For example, the CRUD module used in the project encapsulates database operations, making it reusable for other applications and ensuring it can be easily adapted for different datasets or databases.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
When I approach a problem, I start by analyzing the requirements and understanding the problem and its requirements. I then plan and design a structured solution before diving into coding. Develop the solution in increments, testing each part as you go. For the Grazioso Salvare project, this approach involved designing the dashboard layout, planning database queries, and iterating on each component. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists design, develop, and maintain software systems, addressing complex problems and ensuring systems meet user needs efficiently by following industry standards.  By developing a user-friendly dashboard, the project enhances data management and decision-making, helping the company better track and analyze animal rescue data in a more efficient manner.
